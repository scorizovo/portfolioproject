Title: Broncos Calendar
Overview of Project: This project is meant to be a calendar informing users of the schedule for the NFL team the Denver Broncos, hence the title. However, I currently have not had enough time for the project to serve its intended purpose. However, this website does use a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display a calendar. Additionally, it does use the OpenWeather 3rd party API to display the weather in Denver. In the future, this website will allow users to view the upcoming schedule for the Denver Broncos.# portfolioproject
